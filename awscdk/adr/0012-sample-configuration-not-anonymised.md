# 6. environment variables overrides config file

Date: 2020-06-10

## Status

Accepted

## Context

I left some entries such as my used account ID or account alias in place. It's a throw-away account, fairly 
locked down. Not too concerned you guys will suddenly launch Bitcoin miners in there.
Besides there's no users or groups, it's all SAML/SSO with multi-factor auth. :-P

## Decision

Leave it as is at hand-in, and let the assessor change as needed.

## Consequences

Yeah you know now one of my actual AWS account names as well as some profiles, roles and policies that I use...
